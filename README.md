TO RUN
$yarn
$yarn start

I used create react app.. All the logic is in src/components/calculator.js

TO USE
enter negative numbers, decimals, parenthesis and any of the operations shown
on the calculator using the calculator buttons or the input field and your keyboard.
Press enter with the textfield in focus or the = botton to get the answer. You can use
the most recent answer by clicking the ans() button

To use squareroot enter the number (or numbers in parenthesis)
you wish to get the square of before pressing the SQRT() button.

% only takes the percentage of the number directly preceding it and does this
instantly in the input field. For example 5*6% turns into 5*0.06.

if the input field ends in an operator when submitted a 0 is concatenated on the end

Make sure to have all parenthesis correctly paired. If a parenthesis is missing
you will not get an answer


VERSION 2(Coming soon)
-error handling for parenthesis mismatch related errors
-Functionality to take the percentage of items in parenthesis
-More thorough regex
-more operators
-better UI
-get rid of inline styles
-code broken down into multiple Components
-more concise code
